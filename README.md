This is a simple IRC bot, which will hopefully become increasingly useful and entertaining. Presently, the features include:

* The ability to report on the last commit to the [patchboard][] project if you ask about it.
* The ability to act as a therapist, ala [Eliza][].
* A tendency to get ornery when asked about the weather.

[patchboard]: https://github.com/pandastrike/patchboard
[Eliza]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA

To install and run:

    git clone git@github.com:pandastrike/madpanda.git
    cd madpanda
    npm install
    cp example.config.coffee config.coffee
    
You'll want to edit config.coffee and put your server password in. Then you're set to run it:

    bin/madpanda
  
All the interesting source is in `index.coffee`. The Eliza code is adapted from [aeter/eliza-coffee][].
